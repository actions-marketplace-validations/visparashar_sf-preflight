## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Offline analysis of SFDX source projects, driven by a git diff (`--base`/`--head`) or an
  explicit file list (`--files`).
- Parsers for custom fields (roll-up summaries, formulas), validation rules, record-triggered
  flows (`$Record`, typed variables, Get Records outputs, loops, subflows, Apex actions), Apex
  triggers and classes (heuristic DML/SOQL analysis) and permission sets/profiles.
- Simplified Salesforce order of execution per object and DML event.
- Cascade analysis across objects with cycle (re-entry) detection and a configurable depth.
- Findings: recursion cycles, validation-rule collisions with automated writes, fields used by
  validation rules, new validation rules vs existing automation, after-save self-updates,
  automation density, multiple triggers per object, DML/SOQL in loops, permission escalations
  (diffed against the git base), and deleted components that are still referenced.
- Suggested test plan per change (bulk, recursion, validation-collision, idempotency, boundary,
  permission-negative).
- Markdown (PR-comment ready) and JSON reports; `--fail-on` exit codes for CI.
- `blast-radius explain <Object>` to print an object's save procedure.
- Sample SFDX org fixture reproducing common failure modes.
